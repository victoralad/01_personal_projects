# The time complexity of linkedList is worse than arrays in most cases, but linkedList has a better space complexity.
# Fragmentation faults can occur with arrays when trying to create large contigious blocks of memory that are not possible. 
# It seems almost any algorithm that can be written with stacks, can also be written with recursion. 
# Stacks can be used to check for balanced parenthesis. It can also be used to reverse a string or linkedList
# Queues can be use to perform level-order traversal of trees.
